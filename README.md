## Installations
No special software packages are required.  This repository consists solely of text files.

## Project Motivation
As part of Udacity's *How to Use Git and Github* free class, I had to answer questions reflecting on the value of version control and how Git and Github work.  These files serve as reference material that I can look back on when using Git and Github in the future.

## File Descriptions
There are three text files in this repository:
* `lesson_1_reflections.txt`: Discusses the value of version control and the benefits of Git as a version control method.
* `lesson_2_reflections.txt`: Answers specific questions about how Git works: commits, logs, staging area, branches, etc.
* `lesson_3_reflections.txt`: Discusses the value of having a remote repository such as Github.
