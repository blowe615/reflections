Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: Use a remote repository when collaborating with other people or on multiple machines.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Manually pulling changes means that you always know what changes you are adding from your remote repository.  This is helpful when other people are making commits on your remote.
